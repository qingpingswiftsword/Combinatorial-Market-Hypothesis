New market hypothesis for the AI and Agent Era
Combinatorial Market Hypothesis (CMH)
Vision
Can mathematics and algorithms tame human greed? We believe the future of finance lies in computable optimality—not emotional speculation, manipulation, or opaque rules. Born at the intersection of AI and Web3, the Combinatorial Market Hypothesis (CMH) redefines market dynamics as a "multi-asset, multi-correlation, multi-constraint optimization system," aiming to build a pure Agent-driven trading ecosystem where every decision is rooted in mathematical rigor, every allocation is verifiably optimal, and greed is systematically neutralized by algorithmic constraints.

Core Breakthroughs (Beyond Traditional Market Hypotheses)
Traditional frameworks like EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis) or BFH (Behavioral Finance Hypothesis) fail to address Web3’s unique challenges—interconnected assets, cross-domain risks, and inherent human biases. CMH breaks through these limitations with three paradigm shifts:

1. From "Single-Asset Pricing" to "Portfolio System Optimality"
CMH rejects the myth of independent asset pricing. Instead, it models markets as interconnected networks, using graph algorithms to quantify asset correlations (e.g., node connectivity, subgraph density) and combinatorial optimization to compute globally optimal portfolios. This eliminates catastrophic losses from overconcentrating on correlated assets—an endemic pain point in Web3.

2. From "Identifying Human Bias" to "Eliminating Greed Mechanically"
Unlike behavioral finance (which only names greed as a problem), CMH solves it with algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We calculate threshold values where "manipulation costs exceed gains" (e.g., dynamic transaction fees for abnormal trading) and encode these rules into smart contracts. Pure Agents execute decisions without emotional interference, ensuring no human can bypass risk constraints.

3. From "Static Theory" to "Dynamic Computability"
CMH is not a theoretical abstraction—it’s a real-time, adaptive system. Powered by temporal graph neural networks (TGN) and AI, it recalculates optimal portfolios every 5 minutes to adapt to market volatility. All logics (correlation analysis, risk quantification, portfolio weighting) are computable, verifiable, and open-source—no black boxes.
Technical Pillars
CMH’s architecture unites mathematics, AI, and Web3 to create a self-sustaining, trustless ecosystem:
Mathematical Foundations: Combinatorial optimization (convex programming for portfolio weights), graph theory (correlation risk quantification), game theory (fair mechanism design).
AI & Agent Layer: Pure Agents automate optimal decision execution; unsupervised learning detects deviations from mathematical norms; NLP integrates on-chain sentiment into risk models.
Web3 Infrastructure: Smart contracts enforce immutable rules; on-chain transparency ensures all calculations are auditable; DAO governance aligns the ecosystem with community interests.
